17.7. `plural.py`, stage 6
--------------------------

Now you're ready to talk about generators.

### Example 17.17. `plural6.py`

    import re

    def rules(language):                                                                 
        for line in file('rules.%s' % language):                                         
            pattern, search, replace = line.split()                                      
            yield lambda word: re.search(pattern, word) and re.sub(search, replace, word)

    def plural(noun, language='en'):      
        for applyRule in rules(language): 
            result = applyRule(noun)      
            if result: return result      

This uses a technique called generators, which I'm not even going to try
to explain until you look at a simpler example first.

### Example 17.18. Introducing generators

    >>> def make_counter(x):
    ...     print 'entering make_counter'
    ...     while 1:
    ...         yield x               
    ...         print 'incrementing x'
    ...         x = x + 1
    ...     
    >>> counter = make_counter(2) 
    >>> counter                   
    <generator object at 0x001C9C10>
    >>> counter.next()            
    entering make_counter
    2
    >>> counter.next()            
    incrementing x
    3
    >>> counter.next()            
    incrementing x
    4



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#plural.stage6.2.1) The presence of the `yield` keyword in `make_counter` means that this is not a normal function. It is a special kind of function which generates values one at a time. You can think of it as a resumable function. Calling it will return a generator that can be used to generate successive values of `x`. 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#plural.stage6.2.2) To create an instance of the `make_counter` generator, just call it like any other function. Note that this does not actually execute the function code. You can tell this because the first line of `make_counter` is a `print` statement, but nothing has been printed yet. 

[![3](../images/callouts/3.png)](#plural.stage6.2.3) The `make_counter` function returns a generator object. 

[![4](../images/callouts/4.png)](#plural.stage6.2.4) The first time you call the `next()` method on the generator object, it executes the code in `make_counter` up to the first `yield` statement, and then returns the value that was yielded. In this case, that will be `2`, because you originally created the generator by calling `make_counter(2)`. 

[![5](../images/callouts/5.png)](#plural.stage6.2.5) Repeatedly calling `next()` on the generator object *resumes where you left off* and continues until you hit the next `yield` statement. The next line of code waiting to be executed is the `print` statement that prints `incrementing x`, and then after that the `x = x + 1` statement that actually increments it. Then you loop through the `while` loop again, and the first thing you do is `yield x`, which returns the current value of `x` (now 3). 

[![6](../images/callouts/6.png)](#plural.stage6.2.6) The second time you call `counter.next()`, you do all the same things again, but this time `x` is now `4`. And so forth. Since `make_counter` sets up an infinite loop, you could theoretically do this forever, and it would just keep incrementing `x` and spitting out values. But let's look at more productive uses of generators instead. 

### Example 17.19. Using generators instead of recursion

    def fibonacci(max):
        a, b = 0, 1       
        while a < max:
            yield a       
            a, b = b, a+b 



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#plural.stage6.3.1) The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. It starts with `0` and `1`, goes up slowly at first, then more and more rapidly. To start the sequence, you need two variables: `a` starts at `0`, and `b` starts at `1`. 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#plural.stage6.3.2) `a` is the current number in the sequence, so yield it. 

[![3](../images/callouts/3.png)](#plural.stage6.3.3) `b` is the next number in the sequence, so assign that to `a`, but also calculate the next value (`a+b`) and assign that to `b` for later use. Note that this happens in parallel; if `a` is `3` and `b` is `5`, then `a, b = b, a+b` will set `a` to `5` (the previous value of `b`) and `b` to `8` (the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`). 

So you have a function that spits out successive Fibonacci numbers.
Sure, you could do that with recursion, but this way is easier to read.
Also, it works well with `for` loops.

### Example 17.20. Generators in `for` loops

    >>> for n in fibonacci(1000): 
    ...     print n,              
    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#plural.stage6.4.1) You can use a generator like `fibonacci` in a `for` loop directly. The `for` loop will create the generator object and successively call the `next()` method to get values to assign to the `for` loop index variable (`n`). 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#plural.stage6.4.2) Each time through the `for` loop, `n` gets a new value from the `yield` statement in `fibonacci`, and all you do is print it out. Once `fibonacci` runs out of numbers (`a` gets bigger than `max`, which in this case is `1000`), then the `for` loop exits gracefully. 

OK, let's go back to the `plural` function and see how you're using
this.

### Example 17.21. Generators that generate dynamic functions

    def rules(language):                                                                 
        for line in file('rules.%s' % language):                                          
            pattern, search, replace = line.split()                                       
            yield lambda word: re.search(pattern, word) and re.sub(search, replace, word) 

    def plural(noun, language='en'):      
        for applyRule in rules(language):  
            result = applyRule(noun)      
            if result: return result      



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#plural.stage6.5.1) `for line in file(...)` is a common idiom for reading lines from a file, one line at a time. It works because *`file` actually returns a generator* whose `next()` method returns the next line of the file. That is so insanely cool, I wet myself just thinking about it. 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#plural.stage6.5.2) No magic here. Remember that the lines of the rules file have three values separated by whitespace, so `line.split()` returns a tuple of 3 values, and you assign those values to 3 local variables. 

[![3](../images/callouts/3.png)](#plural.stage6.5.3) *And then you yield.* What do you yield? A function, built dynamically with `lambda`, that is actually a closure (it uses the local variables `pattern`, `search`, and `replace` as constants). In other words, `rules` is a generator that spits out rule functions. 

[![4](../images/callouts/4.png)](#plural.stage6.5.4) Since `rules` is a generator, you can use it directly in a `for` loop. The first time through the `for` loop, you will call the `rules` function, which will open the rules file, read the first line out of it, dynamically build a function that matches and applies the first rule defined in the rules file, and yields the dynamically built function. The second time through the `for` loop, you will pick up where you left off in `rules` (which was in the middle of the `for line in file(...)` loop), read the second line of the rules file, dynamically build another function that matches and applies the second rule defined in the rules file, and yields it. And so forth. 

What have you gained over [stage
5](stage5.html "17.6. plural.py, stage 5")? In stage 5, you read the
entire rules file and built a list of all the possible rules before you
even tried the first one. Now with generators, you can do everything
lazily: you open the first and read the first rule and create a function
to try it, but if that works you don't ever read the rest of the file or
create any other functions.
