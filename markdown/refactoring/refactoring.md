15.3. Refactoring
-----------------

The best thing about comprehensive unit testing is not the feeling you
get when all your test cases finally pass, or even the feeling you get
when someone else blames you for breaking their code and you can
actually *prove* that you didn't. The best thing about unit testing is
that it gives you the freedom to refactor mercilessly.

Refactoring is the process of taking working code and making it work
better. Usually, “better” means “faster”, although it can also mean
“using less memory”, or “using less disk space”, or simply “more
elegantly”. Whatever it means to you, to your project, in your
environment, refactoring is important to the long-term health of any
program.

Here, “better” means “faster”. Specifically, the `fromRoman` function is
slower than it needs to be, because of that big nasty regular expression
that you use to validate Roman numerals. It's probably not worth trying
to do away with the regular expression altogether (it would be
difficult, and it might not end up any faster), but you can speed up the
function by precompiling the regular expression.

### Example 15.10. Compiling regular expressions

    >>> import re
    >>> pattern = '^M?M?M?$'
    >>> re.search(pattern, 'M')               
    <SRE_Match object at 01090490>
    >>> compiledPattern = re.compile(pattern) 
    >>> compiledPattern
    <SRE_Pattern object at 00F06E28>
    >>> dir(compiledPattern)                  
    ['findall', 'match', 'scanner', 'search', 'split', 'sub', 'subn']
    >>> compiledPattern.search('M')           
    <SRE_Match object at 01104928>



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#roman.refactoring.1.1) This is the syntax you've seen before: `re.search` takes a regular expression as a string (`pattern`) and a string to match against it (`'M'`). If the pattern matches, the function returns a match object which can be queried to find out exactly what matched and how. 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#roman.refactoring.1.2) This is the new syntax: `re.compile` takes a regular expression as a string and returns a pattern object. Note there is no string to match here. Compiling a regular expression has nothing to do with matching it against any specific strings (like `'M'`); it only involves the regular expression itself. 

[![3](../images/callouts/3.png)](#roman.refactoring.1.3) The compiled pattern object returned from `re.compile` has several useful-looking functions, including several (like `search` and `sub`) that are available directly in the `re` module. 

[![4](../images/callouts/4.png)](#roman.refactoring.1.4) Calling the compiled pattern object's `search` function with the string `'M'` accomplishes the same thing as calling `re.search` with both the regular expression and the string `'M'`. Only much, much faster. (In fact, the `re.search` function simply compiles the regular expression and calls the resulting pattern object's `search` method for you.) 


![Note](../images/note.png) 
Whenever you are going to use a regular expression more than once, you should compile it to get a pattern object, then call the methods on the pattern object directly.

    # toRoman and rest of module omitted for clarity

    romanNumeralPattern = \
        re.compile('^M?M?M?M?(CM CD D?C?C?C?)(XC XL L?X?X?X?)(IX IV V?I?I?I?)$') 

    def fromRoman(s):
        """convert Roman numeral to integer"""
        if not s:
            raise InvalidRomanNumeralError, 'Input can not be blank'
        if not romanNumeralPattern.search(s):                                    
            raise InvalidRomanNumeralError, 'Invalid Roman numeral: %s' % s

        result = 0
        index = 0
        for numeral, integer in romanNumeralMap:
            while s[index:index+len(numeral)] == numeral:
                result += integer
                index += len(numeral)
        return result



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#roman.refactoring.2.1) This looks very similar, but in fact a lot has changed. `romanNumeralPattern` is no longer a string; it is a pattern object which was returned from `re.compile`. 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#roman.refactoring.2.2) That means that you can call methods on `romanNumeralPattern` directly. This will be much, much faster than calling `re.search` every time. The regular expression is compiled once and stored in `romanNumeralPattern` when the module is first imported; then, every time you call `fromRoman`, you can immediately match the input string against the regular expression, without any intermediate steps occurring under the covers. 

So how much faster is it to compile regular expressions? See for
yourself:

### Example 15.12. Output of `romantest81.py` against `roman81.py`

    .............          
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 13 tests in 3.385s 

    OK                     



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#roman.refactoring.3.1) Just a note in passing here: this time, I ran the unit test *without* the `-v` option, so instead of the full `doc string` for each test, you only get a dot for each test that passes. (If a test failed, you'd get an `F`, and if it had an error, you'd get an `E`. You'd still get complete tracebacks for each failure and error, so you could track down any problems.) 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#roman.refactoring.3.2) You ran `13` tests in `3.385` seconds, compared to [`3.685` seconds](handling_changing_requirements.html#roman.roman72.output "Example 15.9. Output of romantest72.py against roman72.py") without precompiling the regular expressions. That's an `8%` improvement overall, and remember that most of the time spent during the unit test is spent doing other things. (Separately, I time-tested the regular expressions by themselves, apart from the rest of the unit tests, and found that compiling this regular expression speeds up the `search` by an average of `54%`.) Not bad for such a simple fix. 

[![3](../images/callouts/3.png)](#roman.refactoring.3.3) Oh, and in case you were wondering, precompiling the regular expression didn't break anything, and you just proved it. 

There is one other performance optimization that I want to try. Given
the complexity of regular expression syntax, it should come as no
surprise that there is frequently more than one way to write the same
expression. After some discussion about this module on
[comp.lang.python](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.python),
someone suggested that I try using the `{m,n}` syntax for the optional
repeated characters.

    # rest of program omitted for clarity

    #old version
    #romanNumeralPattern = \
    #   re.compile('^M?M?M?M?(CM CD D?C?C?C?)(XC XL L?X?X?X?)(IX IV V?I?I?I?)$')

    #new version
    romanNumeralPattern = \
        re.compile('^M{0,4}(CM CD D?C{0,3})(XC XL L?X{0,3})(IX IV V?I{0,3})$') 



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#roman.refactoring.4.1) You have replaced `M?M?M?M?` with `M{0,4}`. Both mean the same thing: “match 0 to 4 `M` characters”. Similarly, `C?C?C?` became `C{0,3}` (“match 0 to 3 `C` characters”) and so forth for `X` and `I`. 

This form of the regular expression is a little shorter (though not any
more readable). The big question is, is it any faster?

### Example 15.14. Output of `romantest82.py` against `roman82.py`

    .............
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 13 tests in 3.315s 

    OK                     



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#roman.refactoring.5.1) Overall, the unit tests run 2% faster with this form of regular expression. That doesn't sound exciting, but remember that the `search` function is a small part of the overall unit test; most of the time is spent doing other things. (Separately, I time-tested just the regular expressions, and found that the `search` function is `11%` faster with this syntax.) By precompiling the regular expression and rewriting part of it to use this new syntax, you've improved the regular expression performance by over `60%`, and improved the overall performance of the entire unit test by over `10%`. 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#roman.refactoring.5.2) More important than any performance boost is the fact that the module still works perfectly. This is the freedom I was talking about earlier: the freedom to tweak, change, or rewrite any piece of it and verify that you haven't messed anything up in the process. This is not a license to endlessly tweak your code just for the sake of tweaking it; you had a very specific objective (“make `fromRoman` faster”), and you were able to accomplish that objective without any lingering doubts about whether you introduced new bugs in the process. 

One other tweak I would like to make, and then I promise I'll stop
refactoring and put this module to bed. As you've seen repeatedly,
regular expressions can get pretty hairy and unreadable pretty quickly.
I wouldn't like to come back to this module in six months and try to
maintain it. Sure, the test cases pass, so I know that it works, but if
I can't figure out *how* it works, it's still going to be difficult to
add new features, fix new bugs, or otherwise maintain it. As you saw in
[Section 7.5, “Verbose Regular
Expressions”](../regular_expressions/verbose.html "7.5. Verbose Regular Expressions"),
Python provides a way to document your logic line-by-line.

    # rest of program omitted for clarity

    #old version
    #romanNumeralPattern = \
    #   re.compile('^M{0,4}(CM CD D?C{0,3})(XC XL L?X{0,3})(IX IV V?I{0,3})$')

    #new version
    romanNumeralPattern = re.compile('''
        ^                   # beginning of string
        M{0,4}              # thousands - 0 to 4 M's
        (CM CD D?C{0,3})    # hundreds - 900 (CM), 400 (CD), 0-300 (0 to 3 C's),
                            #            or 500-800 (D, followed by 0 to 3 C's)
        (XC XL L?X{0,3})    # tens - 90 (XC), 40 (XL), 0-30 (0 to 3 X's),
                            #        or 50-80 (L, followed by 0 to 3 X's)
        (IX IV V?I{0,3})    # ones - 9 (IX), 4 (IV), 0-3 (0 to 3 I's),
                            #        or 5-8 (V, followed by 0 to 3 I's)
        $                   # end of string
        ''', re.VERBOSE) 



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#roman.refactoring.6.1) The `re.compile` function can take an optional second argument, which is a set of one or more flags that control various options about the compiled regular expression. Here you're specifying the `re.VERBOSE` flag, which tells Python that there are in-line comments within the regular expression itself. The comments and all the whitespace around them are *not* considered part of the regular expression; the `re.compile` function simply strips them all out when it compiles the expression. This new, “verbose” version is identical to the old version, but it is infinitely more readable. 

### Example 15.16. Output of `romantest83.py` against `roman83.py`

    .............
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 13 tests in 3.315s 

    OK                     



[![1](../images/callouts/1.png)](#roman.refactoring.7.1) This new, “verbose” version runs at exactly the same speed as the old version. In fact, the compiled pattern objects are the same, since the `re.compile` function strips out all the stuff you added. 

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#roman.refactoring.7.2) This new, “verbose” version passes all the same tests as the old version. Nothing has changed, except that the programmer who comes back to this module in six months stands a fighting chance of understanding how the function works.
